# Comic Recidivist Mono Ligatures

The programming ligatures used by this font are very nonstandard and experimental, as I focused on several design goals beyond the ones normally found in programming ligatures:
1. Indicate function by associating distinct styling choices with different types operators AND otherwise disambiguating similar operators
2. Avoid obfuscating which characters are contained in the sequences
3. Avoid edge cases where a valid sequence of characters might serve a different purpose
4. Group character sequences that are part of one operator together
5. Make each set of ligatures specific to one programming language

The programming languages that currently have ligature sets are:
* Ruby

I plan on adding several other ligature sets in the near future, and I might also add a general set of ligatures that adhere more closely to the common style of programming ligatures.
