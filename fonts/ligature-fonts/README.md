# Comic Recidivist Mono Ligatures

The programming ligatures used by this font are very nonstandard and experimental, as I focused on several design goals beyond the ones normally found in programming ligatures:
* Indicate function by associating distinct styling choices with different types operators AND otherwise disambiguating similar operators
* Avoid obfuscating which characters are contained in the sequences
* Avoid edge cases where a valid sequence of characters might serve a different purpose
* Group character sequences that are part of one operator together
* Make each set of ligatures specific to one programming language

The programming languages that currently have ligature sets are:
* Ruby
* Markdown Task Lists

I plan on adding several other ligature sets in the near future, and I might also add a general set of ligatures that adhere more closely to the common style of programming ligatures.
